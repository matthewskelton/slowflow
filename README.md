# Slow flow - contexts where fast flow might not be suitable. #fastflow 

The ideas from approaches like [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/) assume a need for fast flow of changes. In 2022 and beyond, it's fair to say that the majority of organizations building and running software-enriched services need fast flow, but there are exceptions.

[Prompted by this tweet](https://twitter.com/matthewpskelton/status/1555633739681652736) (thanks to Muhammad Sufyian (محمد سفیان)), here are some situations where the need for #fastflow might be reduced or not relevant:

- Research and Development (R&D)
- Policy formation
- Artistic creativity
- Palliative care

## Research & Development (R&D)

R&D is concerned with discovery and unknown aspects of a domain, so it's difficult to even know what the domain really contains. If the domain is still unknown, it;s difficult to align to streams of change in the domain.

## Policy formation

Policy formation is a kind of innovation, a bit like R&D, with similar dynamics.

## Artistic creativity

Artisitic creativity generally does not use a linear process but something more chaotic, at least at the individual level. 

## Palliative care

Ideas from TT are being used in many healthcare contexts, especially emergency care, but [end-of-life care (aka palliative care)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/end-of-life-care/what-it-involves-and-when-it-starts/) is possibly less in need of fast flow approaches because the changes needed are minimal.
